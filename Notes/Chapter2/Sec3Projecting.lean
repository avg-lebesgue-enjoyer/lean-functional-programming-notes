/- SECTION: Starting a Project -/

/- To create a new project:
    `lake new projecttitle`
    This creates a folder `projecttitle` and initialises a project within it
  If you already have the folder:
    `lake init`
    This initialises a project within the current folder
  To compile the project you're currently in the folder for:
    `lake build`
    This compiles it into `./build/bin/projecttitle`, an executable file.
